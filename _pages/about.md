I am currently a Graduate Research Associate in the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. For Summer 2020 I participated in the SEPP Program at Collins Aerospace as a Systems Engineering Intern (Guidance, Navigation, Control, and Perception).

In the past few years, I have gained experience in a wide-range of aerospace and robotics applications, with a focus: aircraft system design and optimization; unmanned systems guidance, navigation, control, and perception; machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning for autonomous systems. Some key work includes improved navigation of autonomous systems for disaster response, aerial obstacle detection for safer rotorcraft flight, and integrated trajectory optimization and design for aircraft.

I am passionate about integrating data-driven techniques for autonomous system development and operations, with particular interest in aerial robotics for disaster response and search and rescue. I believe smart, efficient, and safe unmanned systems can improve many lives around the globe in the near future.

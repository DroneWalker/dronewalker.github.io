I am a Graduate Research Associate in the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) of Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, GA. I am working on my Ph.D. in Computational Science and Engineering, an interdisciplinary degree with the School of Aerospace Engineering and the College of Computing.

In the past few years, I have gained experience in a wide range of aerospace and robotics applications with knowledge in linear control, path-planning, computer vision, machine learning, and aerial robotics system design. Some of my recent work includes vision-based navigation of autonomous systems for disaster response, aerial obstacle detection for safer rotorcraft flight, and integrated trajectory optimization and design for aircraft. 

I am passionate about integrating data-driven techniques and vision-based navigation for aerial system operations that improve people's quality of life all over the world. In particular, I am interested in the application of aerial robotics for disaster response, search and rescue, emergency delivery, and transportation.

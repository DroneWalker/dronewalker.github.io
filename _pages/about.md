I am a graduate student at Georgia Institute of Technology who is experienced in a wide-range of aerospace and robotics applications.  My research is focused on system design and optimization, flight dynamics and control, and Artificial Intelligence. I am passionate about integrating artificial intelligence with emerging trends in control theory and path planning for the development and operation of autonomous systems, particularly Urban Air Mobility (UAM) and Small Unmanned Aerial Systems (SUAS).

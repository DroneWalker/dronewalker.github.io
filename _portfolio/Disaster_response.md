Recent years have further proven the case for unmanned aerial systems for improving disaster response and search and rescue applications by removing humans and increasing safety and efficiency. UAS are highly capable of advanced tasks, however, they are still challenged by crowded and complex environments. These applications are critical to saving lives, however, so there is a need for a framework of obstacle avoidance in UAS which utilizes vision-based techniques and learned behaviors to operate at high-speed and use low-cost, vehicle-agnostic sensors and algorithms.
